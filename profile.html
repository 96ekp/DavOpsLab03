<p>
  My name is Eh Klane Phaung, I am 24 years old and I was born in Karen State,
  Burma. There are eight people in my family. My mom is a homeworker and my
  father is a farmer. Life has been challenging for me as I was raised in a
  conflict zone. I am a member of an ethnic minority with limited resources and
  opportunities. In fact, our ethnic groups in Myanmar have been facing the
  vicious cycle of political turmoil and economic crisis even today.
